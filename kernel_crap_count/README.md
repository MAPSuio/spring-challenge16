Somtimes, kernel hackers have a bad day, and express their frustrations
with profanities in their work.

Count how often "crap" occurs in all files of version 4.0.4 of the Linux Kernel
(https://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.0.4.tar.xz).
You can assume that there are no occurences of "crap" in the binary files.

Any of the following counts as an occurence of "crap":
- All combinations of lowercase and upercase letters ("crap", "Crap", "cRap", ..., "CRAP")
- Parts of words ("scrap", "crapola", "cryptocraphic", "pnp_bios_is_utter_crap").
