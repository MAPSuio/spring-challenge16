Imagine *N* alternating circles and squares connected in a
loop. Assign the integers from 1 to *N* to a circle or square such
that the following condition holds:

- Numbers placed in circles must be the sum of its neighbouring
  squares.

The figure above shows the only unique solution when *N* equals 6.

How many unique solutions are there when *N* equals 20?

Two assignments *A* and *B* are equal if the same numbers are assigned
to circles in *A* and *B*, and every number has the same neighbours in
*A* and *B*.
