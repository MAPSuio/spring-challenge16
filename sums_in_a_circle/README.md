Imagine *N* alternating circles and squares connected in a
loop. Assign the integers from 1 to *N* to a circle or square such
that the following condition holds:
- Numbers placed in squares must be the sum of its neighbouring
  circles.

The figure shows the only solution when *N* equals 6.

How many unique solutions are there when *N* equals 20?
