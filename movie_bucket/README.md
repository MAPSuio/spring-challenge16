Ole keeps his Blu-Ray (anachronistic, we know) movies in a stack. All films are unique. Given a history of when
Ole

* buys new films (adds them on top of the stack)
* sells films (removes them from the stack)
* watches films (finds them in the stack, watches them, then puts them back on
  top of the stack)

How deep into the stack is the movie "Gone with the wind"?

The dataset is encoded in the following way:

```
buys The Matrix
watches The Matrix
sells The Matrix
```
