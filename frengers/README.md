Frengers, apart from being the title of an absolutely essential Pop Rock album,
is the concept of being "not quite friends, not quite strangers". You probably
have a few frengers here at IFI.

For our purposes, we will say that two people are frengers if they

1. have met, and
2. have at least 3 friends in common, but
3. are not themselves friends.

Given a history of meetings and friendship formations, determine how many
*pairs* of people are frengers.

The dataset is of the following format:

```
friends kari per
meet kari ola
friends kari petter
friends kari martin
friends kari lone
friends ola petter
friends ola martin
friends ola lone
```

You can assume that each name refers to one and and only one person.

The first entry says that kari and per are friends
The second entry says kari and per have met.

Example:

```
friend kari per
meet kari ola
friend kari petter
friend kari martin
friend kari lone
friend ola petter
friend ola martin
friend ola lone
```
Answer: 1

The answer is one, because kari and ola are frengers.
