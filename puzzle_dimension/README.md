# Enter the puzzle dimension
![Fjords](http://folk.uio.no/larstvei/fjorder.jpeg)

Sigurd recieved a nice jigsaw puzzle with a motive from the norwegian
fjords last christmas. Like any sane jigsaw-puzzler he used the first
hour or so, to sort out the edge pieces (that is, a piece with at least
one straight edge). Sigurd assumed that the jigsaw was a (40 *
75)-jigsaw, since the box it came in, read /Ravensburger 3000/. This
turned out to be wrong, since he ended up with 230 edge pieces after
the sorting, a bit more than expected. He now needs your help to
determine the dimentions of the jigsaw puzzle.

#### Your task

A jigsaw has 3240 pieces, of which 230 are edge pieces. What are the
dimentions of the jigsaw?
Give the answer by spacing the two numbers `n m` where `n <= m` .
